=== Communication platforms

Steps to follow before executing mail command:
1. Firstly, edit email address of the contact at index 1 to your own, preferably an email that is on your phone so that you can easily check if the mail command successfully works.
2. i.e. Type `edit 1 e/youremail@example.com` (replace with your own email address).
3. Ensure that the computer/laptop settings are configured such that there is a default mail of your choice (it can be the mail application on your desktop or it can be an email server on google chrome, etc).
4. Also ensure that there is a working internet connection.

To mail a contact, type mail followed by the index of the contact:
• `mail 1`
OR
• `m 1` (m is the alias for mail)

You should be redirected to your preferred mail and the 'to' field of the message should be filled in with the email address at specified index 1 (i.e. it should be your email address that you just keyed in). You can then fill in the subject and message fields manually and click send. You should receive the email on your phone (if the email address you specified earlier is on your phone).

Steps to follow before executing sms command:
1. Firstly, authenticate the phone number of the contact at index 1 to your own phone number.

The browser panel on top of the CLI should display the google maps page of the contact's address.

To view the social media page of a contact instead of the google map page of their address, type:

The browser panel on top of the CLI should display the contact's social media page.

The browser panel on top of the CLI should refresh to show the google maps page.
