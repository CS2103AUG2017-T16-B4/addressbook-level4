= Manual Testing Script

To load the sample data in the address book,
1. In the same folder as the downloaded `Contags.jar` file, create a folder named `data`.
2. Move `SampleData.xml` (from src/test/data/ManualTesting) to the data folder and rename it as `addressbook.xml`.
3. Open the `Contags.jar` file.

The application should be loaded with the sample data.

=== Removing a Tag from all Contacts: `removeTag`

• To successfully remove a tag from all contacts, identify the tag you want to remove. For example, "Client".

• Type the following command into the command line:

`removeTag Client`

[NOTE]
====
The `removeTag` Command is case-sensitive. The case of the Tag you identify must be the exact case used in the application.
====

•  The "Client" tag should be removed from all contacts in the application.

=== Communication platforms

==== Mail command:
1. Firstly, `edit` email address of the contact at index 1 to your own, preferably an email that is on your phone so that you can easily check if the mail command successfully works.
2. i.e. Type `edit 1 e/youremail@example.com` (replace with your own email address).
3. Ensure that the computer/laptop settings are configured such that there is a default mail of your choice (it can be the mail application on your desktop or it can be an email server on google chrome, etc).
4. Also ensure that there is a working internet connection.

....
To mail a contact, type mail followed by the index of the contact:

• mail 1

OR

• m 1 (m is the alias for mail)
....
You should be redirected to your preferred mail and the 'to' field of the message should be filled in with the email address at specified index 1 (i.e. it should be your email address that you just keyed in). You can then fill in the subject and message fields manually and click send. You should receive the email on your phone (if the email address you specified earlier is on your phone).

==== SMS command:
Steps to follow before executing sms command:

• Firstly, you must have a working Twilio account. Ensure there is a working internet connection. You may use the sample one we have created, or create your own at https://www.twilio.com/

[NOTE]
====
By default, the application is synchronized with the sample Twilio account. If you want to use your own account, you must perform a "reauthenticate" command before continuing.
====


....
Logging into Twilio using the Sample Account:

1. Go to  https://www.twilio.com/login

    Username: justus.wah@hotmail.com
    Password: CS2103Ttestingaccount

2. Check the "I'm not a robot" box, and press login.
....

• Next, you have to verify that the phone number you want to SMS to is authenticated on the Twilio Platform. You should use your own phone number for testing purposes, as you will be receiving a verification code through SMS.

....
Authenticating Your Phone Number on Twilio so Contags can send messages to your phone:

1. After logging in, from the Twilio Console Dashboard, click on the `All Products and Services` Logo on the far left border of the screen.

2. Then, under the "Super Network" Section, click on `Phone Numbers`

3. Now, click on the `Verified Caller IDs` label on the left.

4. Under the Verified Caller IDs Title, click on the `Add new Number` Icon, denoted by the Red Addition Sign.

5. Click on the "text you instead" button that is underlined. Type in your phone number. Ensure that the country code is correct (+65).

6. Click on the "Text Me" Button, and you should receive a verification code on your phone via SMS.

7. Enter the verification code into the Twilio website on your computer.

8. Your phone number is now authenticated on this account.
....

• Now, you can either add yourself as a contact on our Application, or edit a sample contact's phone number to your own.
Recommended: Edit the phone number of the first person using the following command (leave our the country code in the application):

`edit` `1` `p/(your 8 digit phone number)`

• To SMS to your phone number now, use the following format. Fill in the (your text message) portion with the messagee you wish to send to yourself.

`sms` `1` `text/(your text message)`

• You should receive the SMS message on your phone shortly.

---
==== Reauthenticate command:

[NOTE]
====
By default, the application is synchronized with the sample Twilio account. There is no need to reauthenticate the account details further. However, for testing purposes, these steps will verify that the Reauthenticate command works.
====

• The reauthenticate command authenticates the application to access a Twilio account. Each Twilio account has three aspects:

1. Account SID

2. Authentication Token

3. Phone number

• First, try reauthenticating to dummy values. The reauthentication command should respond by informing the user that the Account Details are incorrect:
`reauthenticate` `id/fakeid` `auth/fakeauth` `num/12345678`

• If you have your own Twilio account, you can use this command to synchronize the Application to your twilio account. Otherwise, you can reauthenticate back to the details of our sample account by copying and pasting the command below:

....
reauthenticate id/ACed7baf2459e41d773a5f9c2232d4d975 auth/6a26cc5c91ff355ebf48fe019700920b num/+12082157763
....
• After reauthenticating to the sample Twilio account, you can now send SMS messages. See "SMS Command".
