== Introduction

Contags is an enhanced version of the conventional AddressBook application.
The name "Contags" was chosen as an inspiration to our commitment towards the contacts in the application, with an
inherent focus on ensuring ease of use for consumers as they add to and maintain the relationships that they have. Our
target consumer group are business executives who would largely benefit from the enhancements and commands that we have
developed for this application, which is based upon superior aesthetic design, efficiency, as well as ease of use all in
an attempt to synchronize communication. Ultimately, we hope this brings people together and solidifies both
professional and personal relationships.

This is why the motto "your digital secretary" was chosen, in order to cater to high-profile executives and their needs
to maintain personal and professional relationships through a digital, efficient medium.

The contact particulars that we have chosen to include in this application were selected based upon their relevancy in a
professional setting. Namely, these particulars are: Name, Phone Number, Email, Address, Birthday, Remark, and Tags.
Accordingly, the enhancements that we have made are based upon these seven fields, in attempt to make these fields more
accessible and practically comprehensive as possible for the user.

Written and enhanced in Java, this application also is made readily editable, in order to be further enhanced in Version
2.0 in which we hope to bring across as soon as possible. We project that the current changes to this particular
AddressBook, as well as those that will be brought across in Version 2.0, will make Contags one of the most
professional, aesthetic, and sought-after products in the market on any operating system.

== About

This document is intended to assist first time users with setting up Contags, as well as introducing new users to the functionality of the application. After reading this document, a user should be able to utilise the application with minimal difficulty.

Contags was developed by the CS2103 T16-B4 Team. +
The contact details of the team may be found <<ContactUs#, here>>.

As development of Contags is continuously ongoing, we recommend checking for new updates every 2 weeks, to ensure that your version of Contags is up to date with the latest and most exciting new features.

Having any Java 8 version is not enough. +
This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.
+
.  Download the latest `addressbook.jar` link:{https://github.com/CS2103AUG2017-T16-B4/main}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Address Book.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.

== FAQ

*Q*: How do I transfer my data to another Computer? +
*A*: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the
data of your previous Address Book folder.

*Q*: Does the app work without an internet connection? +
*A*: The primary functions of the application do not require an internet connection, but specific aspects of the app such as the Google Maps search, social media integration, and email functionality cannot function as intended without an active internet connection on your device.

*Q*: What if I want to add 2 different contacts of the same name? Does Contags allow that? +
*A*: Currently, Contags does not allow you to add 2 contacts of the exact same name, and as such we recommend that you append an identifier to the person's name to allow you to save the contact and distinguish between the 2 contacts. We are, however, planning on updating the add command to allow 2 contacts of the same name, as well as assisting you to distinguish between them.

*Q*: Can I use my mouse or keyboard shortcuts to access the app's functions? +
*A*: No. The application was built to rely primarily on the Command-Line Interface and as such is meant to minimise the amount of interactions with other forms of input apart from the keyboard.

*Q*: How does the app work? +
*A*: Those interested in the mechanisms of our application may reference the Developer Guide located <<DeveloperGuide#, here.>>

*Q*: How can I request new features for the app? +
*A*: Suggestions are always welcome and you can provide us with the details of your ideas at devteam@contags.com.sg.

*Q*: How do I report any bugs to the developers? +
*A*: You can send a screenshot with the details regarding the bugs to help@contags.com.sg and we will get back to you as soon as possible.
