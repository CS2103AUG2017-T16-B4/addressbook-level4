== Project: Contags

Contags is an enhanced version of the conventional AddressBook Application, originally forked from the AddressBook Level 4 Repository by the Software Engineering Education team (SE-EDU). It is specifically intended to be utilized by English-Speaking business executives. The three main aspects of Contags that we have focused on to achieve this goal include storing and organising large numbers of contacts, efficient integrated communication, and ease of maintaining business relationships.

The following portion of this project portfolio details my personal contributions to the product.
